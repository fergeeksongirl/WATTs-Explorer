## Reporting a Vulnerability
Because this is a clientâ€‘side, offline app, the surface area is minimal. If you spot an issue:

1. Create a private issue or contact the maintainers (see `SUPPORT.md`).
2. Include steps to reproduce and a minimal HTML snippet or screenshot.
3. Do not include sensitive data.

We aim to acknowledge reports within 5 business days.
